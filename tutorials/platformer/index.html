        <p class="contentheader">Intro -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Hi there! Welcome to The Coder School’s scratch project on making a platformer game! 
            In this project you are going to learn how to make a game with a character that can run and jump their way 
            to the prize! </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Getting Started -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">You can code in Scratch by using blocks that each do something unique. 
            Off to the left, you’ll see that there are groups of different types of blocks that are all 
            different colors. Each one does something new! </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-1.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentheader">Choosing A Sprite -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Right now we just have the cat in our project, let’s take some time 
            to add some more! Go over to the small picture of the cat and click on it, you will be able 
            to see a list of new sprites for us to choose from!</p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-2.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="centercontent">These characters we include in our game are called sprites, we can have 
            them do anything we want with code! Go ahead and try to add in 2 or 3 sprites into your game.</p>

        <p class="contentheader">Lets Get Moving -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now that we have a couple sprites in our game, choose one of them that 
            you want to use as the main character in your game! We are going to start adding movement controls 
            so that they can move around the level. </p>

        <p class="centercontent">Click on your sprite to look at its code:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-3.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Then we will add blocks of code that always check if a key is pressed 
            on the keyboard. Once one of them are pressed, then we will have the character move either left 
            or right.
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-4a.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <br>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-4b.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <br>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-4c.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">One more thing we will need to add are instructions for where our 
            character to start when the game is run. Go to motion and find the “go to” block, it will 
            look like this:</p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-5.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now add it to the first grouping of code, so each time you press 
            the green flag your character will always start at the same place!</p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-6.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentheader">Adding a Background -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Our character is looking pretty good at this point, now let’s add 
            a background! Right now it’s just a white background, but we can take any picture and use 
            it as a background in our game. We have to click on the icon of the picture, and we will 
            be able to see a list of backgrounds for us to use:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-7.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="centercontent">When you see one you like, just click on it and it will become your backdrop!
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-8.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentheader">Jump! -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now we are going to add the ability for our character to jump! We 
            are going to use the “when space key pressed” block, and when our code runs we will use 
            repeat blocks to make our character jump! Go ahead and add this to the code for your character:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-9.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">The next step is to make our character move up and down, using the 
            change y block in motion! Look for the dark blue code group and find this:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-10.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">We are going to add this block twice to our jump code. The first one 
            will be a positive number have our character go up, and the second one will be negative to 
            have our character move down. Like this!:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-11.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentheader">Making a Floor -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now we get to design our floor for our character! Hover over the 
            sprite icon, and go to the paintbrush that let’s us design a sprite’s costume:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-12.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Here we can create the sprite for our floor, we’ll use a rectangle 
            for now. Go over to the tool that shows the rectangle and we will be able to add it to our 
            sprite!
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-13.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Once you like the way your floor is looking, move it to the bottom 
            of the screen so that it is only on the bottom! Like this:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-14.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentheader">Gravity -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">The next step is for us to add gravity to our game! Right now, if 
            you jump a bunch of times, we don’t fall all the way down. Here is how we can change that! 
            We are going to use a forever block to always check if we are touching the color of our 
            floor. If we are *not* touching the color, then our y position will change to move us down 
            in the level!
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-15.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentheader">Adding more platforms -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now is where you get to design the level for your character! Go 
            ahead and either duplicate your ground, or design more sprites that your character can 
            jump onto.</p>

        <p class="centercontent">Hint- Make sure they are the same color so that your gravity code 
            will work with them!
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Collect the Prize -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now that you have your level designed, let’s find one more sprite 
            to be the prize that your character can get at the end of the level. You can use a gem, a 
            coin, even food! Pick out the sprite you think would be good as the prize in your game and 
            add it to the top of the level.
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-16.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now that you have it positioned, try and add some code to make it 
            either move or change appearances! You could use a forever block to rotate it, or do 
            something like this to make it change color over time:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-17a.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <br>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-17b.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentheader">Sound Check -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Your game is starting to really look good! Next we are going to start 
            adding sounds when your character jumps to make the game more interactive. Go ahead and go to 
            the sound section of scratch and begin looking at sounds!
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-18.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="centercontent">Hint- here is the icon to look at the list of sounds:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-19.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Once you found one you like, go ahead and add the sound block of code 
            to your jump controls, so that way when you press space the sound you chose will play!
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-20.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentheader">Winning Screen! -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Here’s the finish line! The last step we need to do is to add 
            code to your player sprite to end the game when they get to the prize!
        </p>

        <p class="centercontent">Here’s how we can set it up:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-21.png" alt="" class="contentpic">
        
        <p class="contentparagraph">To make it more interactive, go ahead and have your character say 
            something when they get the prize!
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/platformerpic-22.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="centercontent">And just like that, you have made your very own platformer game!
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Challenges -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Nice job! If you made it here then you have a working platformer 
            game, pretty sweet! Give these challenges a try and they will really help level up your game.
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Add enemies to the game -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">How do you think we could add enemies to the game? 
        </p>

        <p class="centercontent">Hint- They could have us reset to the beginning if our 
            character touches them.
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Make Level 2! -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Once you collect the first prize, how do you think we could have 
            a second level begin? This is a big idea so don’t worry if the code doesn’t work perfectly 
            the first time! 
        </p>

        <p class="centercontent">Hint- You will need to broadcast a message when your character reaches 
            the first prize, and have all your platforms hide when that message is broadcasted.
