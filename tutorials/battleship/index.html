    <p class="contentparagraph">Hey! This is The Coder School’s very own battleship tutorial!
        If you haven’t played battleship before, the way it works is each player takes a turn
        guessing a spot on the board that has the “enemy” battleship, and if you hit all of
        their ships first then you win. In this project, we are going to build a working version
        in python where we are going to have a certain number of guesses to find the enemy battleship.
        Let’s get started!</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">We are going to be using repl for this project, it is a web based IDE
        (Integrated Development Environment), which is essentially a program that allows us to write
        and run code. Go ahead and try out a couple print statements first to get familiar with writing
        and running in repl!</p>

    <p class="contentheader">Importing Functions -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">The first thing we are going to do is import some
        functions that exist in python for us to use. By importing these functions,
        we don’t have to create them ourselves and makes it so we don’t have to write
        as much. The functions we are going to use include a sleep function from the
        time library, a color function from term color, a random number function from
        the random library, and the operating system functions. <br><br>
        The way we import a function from a library goes like this:</p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-2.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="centercontent">Here is what we need to include at the very top of our python file:
    </p>

    <p class="contentheader">Making Our Variables -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">In our game, we’re going to have to possible items
        in the board, either an empty space or a space that was guessed but it didn’t
        hit the battleship. For these, we are going to make two variables using the
        colortext function from the termcolor library. Here is how we can create them:
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-4.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="centercontent">Go ahead and choose colors that for the two variables that
        you think look good! Termcolor has support for red, green, blue, orange, magenta,
        cyan, and white</p>

    <p class="contentheader">Making Our Board -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Now that we have our variables, we need to set up the
        board we are going to use. We are going to make a list of positions that are each
        the variable of the O that is a color to represent an empty position, and with each
        row being a smaller list. Go ahead and set up the first row like this:
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-5.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentparagraph">Now comes some customization in the game, how large
        should the board be? Keep in mind we will only get a certain number of guesses,
        so the larger the board the more difficult it will be to win. Here is how I will
        make it to be a medium difficulty:</p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-6.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="centercontent">Fun fact: the way we are treating these lists that are inside of
        a larger list is called a matrix! No, not like the movie. Still cool though imo.</p>

    <p class="contentheader">How To Print Our Board -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Great, so we have our matrix that holds all of our board
        positions. The next step is making a function that can print the board our in a
        neat and clean way. What we need to do is go through each list, print each value
        in the list, then move on to the next one. Here is how we can do that:
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-7.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentparagraph">To improve the user experience, let’s also add some
        information about where the columns and rows are so that we can easily look
        at what position we are choosing. Like so:
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-8.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentheader">Generating a Battleship -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Now that we have our board, we need to create a
        battleship each time the game is run. This is where our import call to the randint
        function comes in really handy. What we need to do is make a random column and row
        for our hidden ship, and we can do that by using two variables that each call the
        randint function between the numbers of 0 and the size of your board!
        Here’s how it should look:</p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-9.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentheader">Setting Up Our Game -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">The game is going to start coming together here, trust me!
        Now to set up the game, we are going to use a while loop, this is going to allow us
        to make multiple choices over time and regenerate our board after each “cycle” our
        code does. At first, we’ll have it ask us for our choice of row and column to guess
        where the enemy ship is. Set up your while loop like this for now:</p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-10.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentparagraph">Right now, our input isn’t really doing anything though.
        After we get the user input, we’ll have our board change at that position by
        assigning our other variable we made back at the beginning, the X! Here’s how
        we can do it:</p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-11.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentheader">Turns -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Whenever you run the program, you’ll quickly realize that it
        doesn’t ever stop. That’s because our loop will run as long as we don’t tell it to
        stop, and since we never tell it when to stop it will always run. Not good! A loop
        that always runs can be bad for programs as they won’t let us exit the code, and it
        could even cause your computer to overheat when a loop runs infinitely.
    </p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Here we will edit our while loop to only run a certain number
        of times. Now for me, I’m going to use 10 turns because I feel like that’s a good
        number of guesses, but you can make it as many or as few as you like depending on
        how difficult you want the game to be. Let’s set up our turn variable like this:
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-12.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="centercontent">Now at the end of our loop, we are going to add a conditional
        statement to stop the loop when our turn variable is too big. Like so:
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-13.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentheader">Checking Results -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Sweet, now you have a working turns mechanic! Our
        next step is to make the player’s input be checked to determine if they hit
        the ship, missed the ship, entered invalid input, or already chose that spot.
        The first step will be checking if the player hits the battleship, here’s what
        we will need to add:</p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-14.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentparagraph">Notice how the case goes inside of an if statement,
        that means that all our other possibilities will be in an else statement. Let’s
        begin by modifying where our code assigning a spot to an X is located so that it
        only occurs in the else statement, like so-
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-15.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentparagraph">Now that we have that, we need to check if the player
        chooses something outside of our board! There are 2 cases, where they choose
        a row out of bounds or a column out of bounds. Their code will be similar, but
        pay close attention to which variable names you use! Here’s what we should add
        to our else statement:</p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-16.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="centercontent">Go ahead and test each of our conditions out! <br><br>
        Hint- to make it easier, have our game print out the location of our battleship
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-17.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentparagraph">The last case we need to cover is where the player
        already guessed the location they are choosing. Our code needs to look at that
        position in our matrix, and if the position is an X instead of an O, we will
        tell the user they already guessed it!
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-18.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="centercontent">Nice job, you just made a fully working battleship game!
        If you’ve gotten this far, then I challenge you to these challenges that are
        challenging. &#x1F92F;
    </p>

    <p class="contentheader">---Challenges---</p>


    <p class="contentheader">Create a Border for Your Grid -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Inside of your function for printing the board, how
        do you think we can add a border to make the game look more “official”? Where
        can we use print statements, and what could they be of? Maybe something
        like ———— or +++++++ or ******? Anything goes!
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/battleship-pic-19.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentheader">Using the Sleep Function -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Try to call our sleep function after each line is
        printed in our function that prints the board! Why do that? If we use sleep
        functions to make the board appear like it is “generated” it gives the program
        a much more active user experience and makes the computer seem more interactive.
    </p>

    <p class="contentheader">Add a 2nd Battleship -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">This is for the hardcore gamers. How do you think
        we could add a second battleship into the game? How would we cause the game
        to end only when both ships were hit instead of only one?
    </p>

    <p class="centercontent">(Hint- its in the game loop!)</p>
