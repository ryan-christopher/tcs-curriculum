    <p class="contentheader">Intro -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph"> <a href="https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc?t=7" target="_blank">Hello there!</a> My name
        is
        Alex Yamasaki and I am
        one of the code coaches here at The Coder School. For our coding event, you are going to learn how to make a
        pong game
        using scratch programming language.
        <br>
    </p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">
        Don't worry if you haven't used scratch before, this project that we will work on is a great first program! And
        if you are
        familiar with scratch that's even better, the pong project is perfect for introducing more advanced topics
        as well.
    </p>

    <p class="contentheader">Code Groups -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Scratch has different types of blocks for different purposes! Try to match up the different
        code blocks to each color, and when you're not sure don't be afraid to do some searching.  
        <br><br>
         Here is what the code blocks look like:
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/codegroups.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    
    <p class="contentheader">Your first lines -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">
        Now that you've seen the different blocks, lets see what code looks like in action!  Most of the time 
        the first line will be the "When the green flag is clicked" block under the events group.  Think of it like 
        a play button that runs our code in each sprite.  
        <br><br>
        Try to add these lines to your scratch cat and see what happens!
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/firstlines.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentparagraph">Always look at the screen to the right to see what happens with our output.
        And if you want to try to play around with the backdrop button to change what the background looks like!
    </p>

    <p class="contentheader">Getting Started -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">For Today we are going to use scratch. It's a block based visual programming language
        for kids to give a basic understanding to code. Create a new project and apply this to our project


    </p>

    <p class="centercontent"><img src="pictures/scratch_code_block1.PNG"></p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Notice when the green flag is clicked, the sprite is moving forever. if we adjust the
        number inside of steps, it will change the movement by little but still doesn't stop. We will be using "when the
        green flag is clicked", event in able to create our game!
    </p>

    <p class="contentheader">Sprites & Backdrop //Desiging our pong game -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">
        Sprites are the images on a Scratch computer program screen. Every Scratch program is made up of sprites and the
        scripts (instructions) that control them. We are able to create/get existing sprites from scratch and customize
        them.</p>

        <br>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Here is where we can add more sprite to our project and even design our own!</p>
        <br>
    
    <img src="pictures/makespriteicon.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentparagraph">
        A backdrop is an image that can be shown on the Stage. It is similar to a costume, except that it is shown on
        the stage instead. We can design our backdrop or get pre-existing backdrops from scratch. So we need to create a
        tall-slim rectangle for our paddles. We would also add a small circle dot.
    </p>

    <img src="pictures/spritelayout.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

    <p class="contentparagraph">Note that the instructions for backdrop and sprites is that we can customize them.
        <em style="color:rgb(0, 204, 0);">imagination can be reality</em>

    <p class="contentheader">Creating Movement For Our Pongs -</p>

    <p class="contentparagraph">Now that you've designed yourself pongs and a ball. We need to implement movement for
        our pongs. Everytime I press a specific key, my pong would go up or down. How do you think we can implement this
        in scratch?
    </p>
     <br>
        <p class="centercontent">
            hint: <br> use the green flag event, then a forever statement. <br> Inside a forever statement, add if/then
            statement.<br> Inside the if/then statement, you can add a (key) is pressed. Then it would change the Y
            cordinate.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="contentparagraph">
            Should look something like this:
            <img src="pictures/movement.PNG" alt="" class="contentpic">
        </p>

    

        <p class="contentheader">Ball mechanic -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">So for our ball, we want to set a position in the middle as we click the green flag.
            Also too, we want it to go point it in a different direction as we click the green flag.
            <br>
            Here's an example:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/ball_position.PNG" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now we need to implement a forever statement for our ball to move permanently. We
            would implement a bouncing situation if it touches the edges, then it would bounce.
            <br>
            Like this:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/Scratch_Code.PNG" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">The output is able to make the ball bounce around the edges of the map.</p>


        <p class="contentparagraph">Now we need to implement another piece of code whenever the ball touches the pong,
            it will bounce back at different direction. We need to use sensor, control and operatives to solve this.
            <br><br>
            For Score detection, maybe we can design our canvas to have a different lines of a color. Whenever the ball
            touches the
            line color, it would go back to the center and move in a different direction after that.
        </p>

        <p class="centercontent">Hint: for making it bounce back.<br> Use if/then statements and connect it with
            touching
            sprite. Inside the if/then
            statement, include a point in direction and inside of it, pick a random direction.
            Now inside the direction, depending on the padding facing it would make the ball bounce back.</p>
        <br>

        <p class="contentheader">Challenge **Extra -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">We need to create variables of eachother score, creating a variable in scratch is
            simple!
            <br><br>
            Now we need to use math operations by our ball position if it's a specific area, then it goes to a specific
            variable. For this, we can use greater than or lesser than and insert ball sprite x-position and solve this!
        </p>
