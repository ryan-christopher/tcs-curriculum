        <p class="contentheader">Intro -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Yo! This is The Coder School’s beginner website project! 
            If you have never made a website don’t worry this is going to be a fun learning 
            experience and if you have some experience making a website then that’s perfectly 
            good too. We’re going to build a webpage that is about you and your interests, kind 
            of like a social media page but one you make yourself.
        </p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">For this project, we’re going to use the repl platform. Go 
            ahead and look around on the repl page, you should see an HTML file, a CSS file, 
            and a JS file. These stand for HyperText Markup Language (fancy words for the text 
            on the screen), Cascading Style Sheets (fancy words for the colors and appearance 
            of the webpage), and JavaScript (a language that adds functions to a website).  For 
            today, we are going to only focus on HTML and CSS!</p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-1.jpg" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentheader">Your First Title -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">The first thing I want you to look at is the existing code 
            in our HTML file. It may seem like a lot to take in but don’t worry it’ll start making 
            sense really quickly! Here is what you should see to start off -</p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-2.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">You’ll see that each HTML tag begins with < something > 
            and ends with </ something >. In this case, let’s look at where it says < body > 
            on line 9 and </ body > on line 11. Right after line 9 is where we are going to 
            focus on for now, so go ahead and make some new lines like this -</p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-3.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Let’s add a title to your webpage! Add this code somewhere 
            in your new section of empty lines in the body tag:
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-4.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Go ahead and press the green run button and watch your 
            webpage update to your newly added code! Now here is where your ideas start to 
            come into play- what do you want this webpage to be about? Your interests? Music 
            you like? Something academic? Totally up to you. Go ahead and make sure your header 
            (the h1 text) is related to your webpage’s topic.
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Getting Descriptive -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now that you have yourself a header, let’s give some more 
            info to this site! Right underneath your </h1>, go ahead and make a new tag, but 
            instead of using h1 we are going to make a paragraph. Here is how we start one:
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-5.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="centercontent">Once you have a couple sentences, go ahead and run the program 
            again and see how your new text is added. How is it different from the h1 text? Is 
            it the same color, size, position? 
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">A Splash of Color -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Here is where some of the real fun begins. Up until now your 
            webpage has been a white background with black text, pretty basic and simple. Let’s 
            start to jazz this page up a bit. Go click on your style.css file on the left, it 
            should be a fully empty file.
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-6.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">CSS lets us change the way things look in our page. Things like 
            font-size, background color, text color, and spacing are all things controlled by CSS. 
            The first thing we will change is the background color of our entire page. Go ahead and 
            add this into your css file:
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-7.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">You can pick any color you want! Feel free to play around with 
            some colors too, web design is all about being unique and customizing a webpage. Once 
            you’re comfy with your background color, we’re going to change the color of your header 
            text. Let’s add this to your file:
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-8.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Just like we changed our whole pages background color, we can 
            change certain parts of the html file as well. In this case, we are changing the text 
            color of only the h1. Here is where you get to freestyle a bit- try and change the color 
            of the text in your paragraph!
        </p>

        <p class="centercontent">Hint- make a new css selector for the p{ tag and change the color 
            that way!
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">1 Pic=1000 Words -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Your website is looking pretty fancy, but lets make it <b><em>fancy.</em></b> 
            Pictures give website a bunch of street cred, and your page will look way more professional that way. 
            Here is where you need to do some searching, go look for some pictures related to your website’s topic, 
            and once you find one or two you like save them and make sure they are named something memorable (for 
            example, a picture of a red car I would name redcar.png). Once you have that, we can upload it to repl!
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-9.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now our image doesn’t magically appear just yet. We need to add code to our html 
            file to tell the image to show up. Here is how we add images:
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-10.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now odds are, your picture will either be WAY too big or WAY too small. That’s 
            okay! This is where CSS will be our best friend.
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Edit time -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">So we have an image that is way out of place, that’s all good! In CSS, 
            you can change the size, position, and even borders of pictures. Go to your css file, and here 
            is the first thing we can add:
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-11.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Notice how after the number, there are the two letters px. That stands 
            for how many pixels wide the picture will be! Go ahead and make the width be whatever you think 
            looks good!
        </p>

        <p class="centercontent">Here are some other things we can add to the picture to really make it look nice:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-12.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Go ahead and play around with each of these values to see how your image 
            can change in appearance!
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Making a Table -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">So you now have a title, paragraph, and image- not bad! Now let’s 
            start a bigger section, the table! Go back over to your html file and add this code to start 
            your table:</p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-13.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Notice how we are dealing with three types of tags. The first one is 
            table which starts our table section, the next is tr which starts the table row, and the last 
            is td which starts the table data. Here is what we can start filling in:
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-14.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="centercontent">Now its up to you to choose what type of information the table will 
            contain. Will it be your favorite movies? Foods you like? Colors you think work well together? 
            Up to you!
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Changing the font -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now we get to start changing the way our text looks! Go ahead and 
            open a new tab up, and go to google.fonts.com. Here, you will see a TON of different fonts 
            that we can choose from. Go ahead and pick one out that you like, and click on it. It should 
            take you to a page that looks like this:
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-15.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Now, press the button that says “select this style” and you should see 
            something pop up at you with two sections of code!  The first will be html code, and the second 
            will be css code.
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-16.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Go ahead and copy the first section, then head to repl and paste the 
            code into the head section of your html file. It should be right after line 7. Here is what 
            it should like like once you have it pasted:
        </p>
        
        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-17.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="contentparagraph">Right now your page won’t look any different yet because we haven’t 
            told the text to change in our css! Let’s copy the second group of code from google fonts, 
            and we are going to paste it inside of our css file. For now we are going to apply the new 
            font everywhere, so inside of the first block of css code changing the background color for 
            the html is where we will paste it. Like so:
        </p>

        <img src="pictures/aboutmepic-18.png" alt="" class="contentpic">

        <p class="centercontent">Now you have yourself a sweet new font for your webpage, nice job!
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Make it Your Own -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">Here is where you get to try some things out on your own. Now that 
            you have a title, paragraph, image, table, and new fonts, play around with some css rules 
            that you made! See if you can change the font sizes of your h1, add a second image, or even 
            apply a second font. The sky is the limit.</p>

        <p class="contentheader">---Challenges---</p>

        <p class="centercontent">If you’ve made it here, you are a level 99 web developer. At this point, 
            you’ve made yourself a full webpage and these are going to be some challenges!
        </p>

        <p class="contentheader">Hover Transitions -</p>

        <p class="contentparagraph">See if you can make your title change color only when you hover over it.
        </p>

        <p class="centercontent">Hint- 
        </p>
